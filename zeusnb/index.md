title: "Ancient interactive notebooks"
---

Documents mixing prose text with machine-executable code have been around for decades (at least as early as Knuthâ€™s `tangle` and `weave` programs to support [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) in the early 1980s).

But the idea of mingling blocks of prose with functional blocks of documents is ancient, and characteristic of all of Claudius Ptolemy's works.

I'm experimenting with ways to represent Ptolemy's notions of "functional documents" using contemporary systems like Jupyter notebooks.

## Work in progress

- initial work on a digital edition of [Ptolemy's *Harmonics*](harmonics/)
