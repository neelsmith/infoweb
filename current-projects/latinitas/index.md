title: "Latinitas / latinitates"
---


>  Abstract: Generalized observations about "Latin" that may be valid for large bodies of texts can break down when we focus on specific corpora.  By defining criteria for characterizing individual corpora, we can more effectively isolate where their usage is similar or different.

Some preliminary Jupyter notebooks illustrating ways to describe a corpus are available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/hctexts-ipynb/master).
