title: Ancient Roman tweeting
---



> Abstract: I want to compare the state-sponsored messaging disseminated on coins across five centuries of the Roman Empire to modern tweeting. The fundamental data source is the *Online Coins of the Roman Empire* <http://numismatics.org/ocre/>.


I'm outlining here my preliminary work with data from the *Online Coins of the Roman Empire* and with *Roman Republican Coins Online* in a series of linked blog posts with accompanying Jupyter notebooks.  Links to notebooks are to `mybinder.org`:  they are also available from <https://github.com/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter>.
