- *latinitas* **/** *latinitates*. <br/>![Priscian](/assets/img/codsang904-p37.png) Digital text corpora allow us to think about "Latin" from a systematic, corpus-linguistic perspective. With
 explicitly defined orthographic systems and corpus-specific morphological parsers, we can compare features of different texts to isolate more clearly what is common to Latin usage and what is distinctive to individual corpora.  See [more information](latinitas/).

-  **γεωγραφία / geographia / جغرافية**.   <br/>![Hulls](/assets/img/ptol-icon.png)  The largest scientific dataset surviving from the ancient world is the record of more than 6,000 sites, including longitude-latitude locations, in Claudius Ptolemy's *Geography*.  The spatial density and precision of Ptolemy's coordinates, in Greek manuscripts and in translations and extensions of Ptolemy's work in later Arabic and Latin sources, helps us understand how these data were used by ancient and medieval scientists.  See [more information](geography/).


- **Ancient Roman tweeting**.  <br/>![Trajan](/assets/img/1925.172.47.obv.jpg) This project studies the state-sponsored messaging disseminated on coins across five centuries of the Roman Empire.  The fundamental data set is derived from the *Online Coins of the Roman Empire* (<http://numismatics.org/ocre/>), "a joint project of the American Numismatic Society and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University."  See [more information](tweeting/).


-  **"Social networks" in *scholia* to the *Iliad*.**  <br/>![Hairball](/assets/img/socnet-icon.png) The *scholia* to the *Iliad* illuminate the backstories and  cultural knowledge shared by the audience of the Homeric poems. This project applies social network analysis to collocations of named entities in the *scholia*.  The project uses archival data from the Homer Multitext project (<http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-archive/>), and focuses initially on the uniquely important *scholia* of the Venetus A manuscript, now available for the first time in a complete edition.



- **Manuscript networks**.  <br/>Traditional stemmatic approaches to reconstruct the transmission of texts assume that manuscripts have a single source.  This assumption is often demonstrably false, and the logic of stemmatic criticism then fails.  This project models networks of interrelated manuscripts to develop a more realistic and nuanced picture of textual transmission.  In this approach, each node in the network is a full diplomatic edition of a manuscript.


- **Gregorian chant**.  <br/>![Einsiedeln 121](/assets/img/chant-icon.jpg)  The chant project is editing manuscripts with musical annotation in *neumes*.  Latin text and *neumes* are represented as parallel texts, with *neumes* encoded in the Virgapes system (<https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/The-Virgapes-System>). We can computationally analyze the musical notation or Latin text alone,  or in relation to each other.
