A [previous post](http://neelsmith.info/hc/2019-11-30-reading-nomisma/) introduced the `nomisma` library to load and read data from nomisma.org.  As with any data set, the next question is:  what's in it?

A [Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter/master?filepath=building%2FVerifying_ocre.ipynb) shows how you can briefly survey the contents of the `Ocre` object that the `nomisma` library creates from `nomisma.org`'s RDF data, and validate that it contains sane values.  The notebook is `building/Verifying_ocre.ipynb` in [the github repository](https://github.com/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter), or you can read it on `mybinder.org` [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/nomisma-jupyter/master?filepath=building%2FVerifying_ocre.ipynb).
