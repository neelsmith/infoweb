On Monday, March 23, Holy Cross courses enter a distance-learning phase. I've updated my [contacts page](http://neelsmith.info/holycross/contact) to reflect that.

In addition to links to my updated (and still evolving) course syllabi, it includes "drop-in" hours when you can reach me by video or audio conference without a prior appointment -- and of course, the continuing Friday afternoon block for my work with the Holy Cross [Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club](http://hcmid.github.io).
