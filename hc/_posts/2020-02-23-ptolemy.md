I'm getting the chance this semester to work with some excellent students on Ptolemy's *Geography*.  To start things off, we're using a TEI-compliant edition of the *Geography*, and a code library that can extract Ptolemy's database of more than 6,000 points with longitude-latitude locations.  We're validating the TEI text's syntax using [this package for the free Atom editor](https://github.com/neelsmith/atomic-tei), we're analyzing the contents of the points database with Jupyter notebooks, and then we're dropping a delimited-text version of the extracted data into QGIS for spatial analysis and cartographic visuialization.  

I've also formatted the text as markdown pages you can retrieve by canonical reference, [here](http://neelsmith.info/current-projects/geography/).


I'll add posts here as we progress.
