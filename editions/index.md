title: "Citable editions"

I'm beginning to develop citable manuscript facsimiles [on this site](https://browsable-mss.netlify.app/).  I'll be blogging about that work periodically here.

I'm also slowly assembling citable editions of a few texts that I'm especially interested for the study of ancient science.  Those editions are showing up [on this site](https://episteme-texts.netlify.app/).

Both the browsable manuscripts and the simple text editions are on `netlify`  and are live-synced with github repositories.
