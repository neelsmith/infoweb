title:  Code libraries
---

When necessary for my teaching or research, I write code.

## Overview

My public repositories are on [github](https://github.com/neelsmith), but for libraries that might be useful to someone else I also publish binaries on [bintray](https://bintray.com/neelsmith/maven).

Pages for tutorials and end-user documentation are generated with the [tut doucmentation generator](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut), so all embedded code has executed correctly.


- libraries for working with [citable scholarly resources](citelibs/)
- libraries for working with text in [ancient Greek or Latin](langlibs/)
- libraries for [scholarly editing projects](editinglibs/)
- other [utility libraries](utilslibs/)



## Why Scala

For the past couple of years, I've been working primarily in Scala, and am deeply in love with it.  I'm writing increasingly purely functional, type-safe code, and am far more productive than ever before because the data structures and code I'm working with are a closer and more natural fit to the way I think about what I study.  I'm still amazed that you can cross-compile Scala to Javascript, so that talented colleagues like Christopher Blackwell can use the same libraries in web apps (like his beautiful [LSJ](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/) or [Lewis-Short](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html) lexica) that  I use from Scala to analyze material for the Homer Multitext project.
