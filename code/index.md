title:  Code libraries
---

When necessary for my teaching or research, I write code.

For the past couple of years, I've been working primarily in Scala, and am deeply in love with it.  I'm writing increasingly purely functional, type-safe code, and far more productive than ever before because the data structures and code I'm working with are a closer and more natural fit to the way I think about what I study.  I'm still amazed that you can cross-compile Scala to Javascript, so that talented colleagues like Christopher Blackwell can use in web pages like his beautiful [LSJ](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/) or [Lewis-Short](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html) lexica the same libraries I use from Scala to analyze material for the Homer Multitext project.

## Where to get it

My public repositories are on [github](https://github.com/neelsmith), but for any libraries that might be useful to someone else I also publish binaries that you can use on other JVM platforms on [bintray](https://bintray.com/neelsmith/maven).

I plan to add to this page a more useful guide to navigating the material on bintray.
