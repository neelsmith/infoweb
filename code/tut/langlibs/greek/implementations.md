The library defines an abstract trait, `GreekString`

-   the [`GreekString`](../greekString) trait

In the current version, the Greek string trait is implemented by the following classes:

-   `LiteraryGreekString`: polytonic Greek in the orthography of modern print editions. [User's guide  and tutorial](../litgreek)
-   `AtticGreekString` (in development): a digital representation of the Athenian writing system prior to the alphabetic reform of the archon Euclid (403 BCE).
