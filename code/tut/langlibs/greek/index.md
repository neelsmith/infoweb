title: Greek string library
---

In the twenty-first century, it's still not possible to use internet standards to represent ancient Greek digitally.  The library documented here offers a way to work with semantically explicit representations of the numerous alphabetic writing systems used in the archaic and classical Greek world.

All Greek strings are represented in two formats:

1.  Unicode code points in form NFC
2.  a primarily or exclusively ASCII representation
