Will future generations find it inexplicable that we scholars in the early days of digital technologies build systems that run on computers, then use the same computers to compose prose that discusses but does not interoperate with the systems we have built?

I am deeply interested in [how to rethink the challenges of writing with and about digital scholarship][writing].  Nevertheless I occasionally add to the pool of conventional-format publications that I expect future scholars will find so puzzling.  A few recent publications:
