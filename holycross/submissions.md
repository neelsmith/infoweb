## Hard-copy assignments

- all hard-copy text should be double spaced to leave me room to make comments
- staple multiple pages: no paper clips or binders please
- please make sure to include your name (or names for group assignments) on the first page


## Digital assignments

Any requirements about formats and conventions for file names will be specified in the directions for your assignment.

1. At the beginning of the semester, create a public repository on [github](https://github.com/) for your course work, and send me a link to your repository.  I will clone your repository.
2. Push your work to the repository by the due date.  I will pull your repository after the deadline to review your work.

(Here's a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUcfS6VHaxZDJ_yx7jLYX4hupbJAOc_Om) with some videos to help you get started with basic digital tools, including this [introduction to working with `git`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQXE8E0U9a8&list=PLUcfS6VHaxZDJ_yx7jLYX4hupbJAOc_Om&index=2&t=135s).)
