When reading connected Greek prose, it can be  helpful to approach a passage with a regular method, even if this seems somewhat
mechanical.  I like to suggest the following four steps (with links to more detail about each step):

1. Identify the [principal clause](principalclause/)
2. Identify [secondary clauses](secondaryclauses/)
3. Identify [attributive participles](attributiveptcpls/)
4. Identify  [circumstantial participles](circumstantialptcpls/)
