title: How to get a letter of recommendation
---

-   meet with me two weeks before the letter is due
-   brief me on the program or job you're applying to
-   bring a current résumé, and a current draft of any personal statements you're submitting with your application
-   get the deadline for your letter added to my calendar of recommendations
