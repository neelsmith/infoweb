Bintray is the perfect complement to a versioned source control host like github:   versioned binaries available through a variety of protocols (Maven, Gradle, Ivy... )  Bintray also has a [public REST API](https://bintray.com/docs/api/) that returns a straightforward JSON description of packages.

To automate collecting and formatting information about bintray packages in markdown so I could include it on web sites, I put together a Scala package, with a quick guide [here](https://github.com/neelsmith/btreporter/blob/master/docs/index.md).

## Overview of reporting on bintray packages

You instantiate a `BintrayRepo` object from owner and repository names:

```
val owner = "neelsmith"
val repo = "maven"
val btRepo = BintrayRepo(owner, repo)
```

You can collect `BintrayPackage`s from the repository by name, or from a vector of names.  The result is one or more scala `Option`s, so we can `flatten` a list to get `BintrayPackage`s.

```
val pkgNames = Vector("greek", "latphone", "gsphone")
val langPkgs = btRepo.bintrayPackages(pkgNames).flatten
```

You can use normal Scala to sort the list, say alphabetically, by name:

```
val alpha = langPkgs.sortWith(_.name < _.name)
```

Repository objects have a function for writing the header of a markdown-formatted table;  package objects have a function for describing the package in a markdown row.  Again, with a little normal Scala, you can put a whole markdown table together in one line:

```
val mdTable = btRepo.markdownTableHeader + langPkgs.map(_.markdownRow).mkString("\n")
```

## Output

The output is a github-flavored markdown table.  On this web site, it is displayed like this:

## To use it

The source code is available on github <https://github.com/neelsmith/btreporter>, along with a [brief tutorial here](https://github.com/neelsmith/btreporter/blob/master/docs/index.md).

Binaries, of course, are available on bintray!  At <https://bintray.com/neelsmith/maven/btreporter> you can find coordinates for maven, etc, to use in your build system, or download it direclty.
